Simplify model to optimizate our diet according to our preferences

## Overview
This project proposes a simplified yet scalable model to help individuals design optimal meal plans aligned with their budget, dietary preferences, and fitness goals. Users can prioritize either minimizing environmental impacts such as CO₂ emissions and water usage or maximizing nutritional values, such as protein intake. By accommodating diverse user needs, the model offers a robust framework for personalized and sustainable meal planning, which can be expanded to include broader dietary considerations.

## Data Description
The dataset, based on information from the U.S. Agriculture Department, includes detailed nutritional values (macronutrients and micronutrients) for over 500 dishes. Additional enhancements were made by categorizing dishes as vegetarian or non-vegetarian and specifying their suitability for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Costs were added in CAD, based on Montreal’s 2024 averages, with adjustments for consistency. Environmental impact metrics, including CO₂ and water footprints, were estimated using Generative AI models and validated to ensure logical alignment across food categories. This resulted in a reliable dataset for balanced optimization between nutrition, cost, and sustainability.

## Conclusions
The project effectively demonstrated the trade-offs between nutritional adequacy and sustainability in meal planning. For instance, prioritizing protein increases cost and environmental impact, while focusing on sustainability reduces CO₂ and water usage but compromises protein intake. Future iterations should incorporate additional macronutrients, micronutrients, and region-specific datasets to enhance practicality and alignment with local food availability. This will further refine the optimization process, ensuring balanced diets tailored to diverse user needs.

## Future implications and Extensions
Enhancements could include dynamic inputs such as taste preferences, allergy considerations, and meal substitutions for greater user customization. Expanding to household level planning would address varied family dietary needs while reducing food waste. Prioritizing local ingredients and penalizing long distance transportation would promote sustainable diets and support regional agriculture. Business opportunities include partnerships with fitness companies, grocery delivery services, and eco certification programs, offering subscription based meal plans that integrate convenience, sustainability, and personalization.
